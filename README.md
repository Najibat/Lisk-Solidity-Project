# Lisk-Solidity-Project

This project features a Solidity smart contract called `UserProfile.sol` designed for managing decentralized user profiles. It was developed as part of a team assignment focusing on Git collaboration, smart contract development, and Remix IDE workflow.

## 📦 Overview

The `UserProfile.sol` contract enables:
- Creating and storing user profiles (username, email, bio, and avatar URL)
- Updating profile details securely
- Deleting a profile
- Storing all data directly on-chain

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Solidity (v0.8.x)** — Smart contract language
- **Remix IDE** — Writing and testing contracts
- **Git & GitHub** — Version control and collaboration
- **Tailwind CSS (optional)** — For related frontend styling
